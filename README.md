# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A **Machine Learning–based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies to users based on content similarity.  
This project demonstrates the core working principle behind recommendation engines used by platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime.



## 📌 Project Overview
The system recommends movies by analyzing movie features and calculating similarity scores.  
It uses **content-based filtering**, where recommendations are generated based on the attributes of movies rather than user behavior.



## 🔍 How It Works
1. Movie data is preprocessed and cleaned  
2. Important features are extracted  
3. Text vectorization techniques are applied  
4. Cosine similarity is used to measure similarity between movies  
5. Top recommended movies are displayed based on user input  



## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLP (CountVectorizer / TF-IDF)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Output
The system takes a movie name as input and returns a list of **recommended movies** based on similarity.



## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Deploy as a **Streamlit web application**
- Add **collaborative filtering**
- Improve recommendations using hybrid models
- Integrate a real-time movie dataset
